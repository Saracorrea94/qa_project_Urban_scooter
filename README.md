🛴 Functional and API Testing Project – URBAN SCOOTER

📝 Project Overview

This project involves functional and API testing of a delivery application for scooter rentals, covering both web and mobile platforms. Manual validation was performed to ensure the correct behavior of functionalities for both the delivery driver and the user.

Test activities included:

Manual testing of key features on web and mobile

API testing to verify backend endpoints

Data validation through SQL queries

Visual design verification by comparing live interfaces against Figma prototypes

💻 Technologies Used

Postman – API testing

Android Studio (with Emulator) – Mobile functional testing

Chrome DevTools – Web debugging and inspection

SQL – Database querying for data validation

Figma – Design prototype reference

JIRA – Bug tracking and defect reporting

👩‍💼 Key Responsibilities

Designed and executed comprehensive positive and negative test cases for both web and mobile features

Performed API testing using Postman to validate endpoint responses and error handling

Validated backend data consistency through SQL queries on remote servers
